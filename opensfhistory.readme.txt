to see wayback machine snapshots:

sudo gem install wayback_machine_downloader_straw

(note need to use "straw" branch)

sample run:

wayback_machine_downloader -f 20240101 -t 20240201 www.gearedsteam.com

add -c N for concurrency (20 seems ok) -- or actually, that might get you blocked

what we really want (jun 24 seems to be well captured):

wayback_machine_downloader -f 20240101 opensfhistory.org 

(I actually went farther back, but there's something odd here; image description files are at locations like https://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.0654.jpg (actually html and not jpg content), but not captured very well.  go go into opensfhistory.mygrab and run:

du -ah ../websites/opensfhistory.org/Image/ | grep 'jpg$' | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/.*\///g;' | awk '{print "wget https://opensfhistory.org/Display/"$1}' | sh

then copy all these "jpg" files to ../websites/opensfhistory.org/Display/
